## Function ABI

* offset 0 is for returning a value.
* offset 1 is for the return pointer, holding the pointer of the instruction after the call that sent it to the function.
* offset (3 + parameter value) is for referencing the pointer for the parameter.
* offset (3 + parameter count + symbol value) is for variables and values generated by the function.
* the compiler is supposed to try and provide enough buffer space for offset 0, so that it can save as much space in memory as possible without sacrificing too much performance.
