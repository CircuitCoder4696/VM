## Function ABI

* offset 0 is for returning a value.
* offset 1 is for the return pointer, holding the pointer of the instruction after the call that sent it to the function.
* offset 2 is for the variable `this`, but could be null for regular functions.  
* offset (3 + parameter value) is for referencing the pointer for the parameter.
* offset (3 + parameter count + symbol value) is for variables and values generated by the function.
* the compiler is supposed to try and provide enough buffer space for offset 0, so that it can save as much space in memory as possible without sacrificing too much performance.
* symbols offsets are used to determine what instruction has to be generated in order to either load or store a value's pointer or value if it is a `size_t`.

# Method ABI

* same as [Function ABI](Function ABI).
* offset 2 stores the offset of the instanes fields.
* offset 3 stores the offset of the object fields, which are static fields.
